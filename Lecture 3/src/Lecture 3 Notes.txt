Java Basics Overview:
    1. Java is platform independent programming lang.
    2. OOps Language
    Adv:
        Portability (WORA)

    3 Main Components in Java:
        JVM - Java Virtual Machine
            Abstract Machine - Doesn't exist physically

    Java Program (Platform independent) -> Compiler -> Byte Code -> JVM (Because of JVM, we get portability) -> Machine Code -> CPU -> Output

    JVM -> Platform dependent

    MacOS JVM is different and Windows is different

    JVM has JIT Compiler and understands byte code

    Java Program (filename.java) -> passes through compiler -> Byte code (filename.class)

    JRE -> Java Runtime Environment
    JRE has JVM + class libraries (java.math, java.util)

    With only JRE, we can run any Java program, we can't just have JVM






1. Main method should be inside public Class
2. Public Class name should be same as file name in Java

Why 1. ?
JVM is used to invoke main method, it needs access to the method and it is declared with 'static' keyword because
JVM can call with class name
    ANew.main()

    so class is defined as public so that class is available to JVM

Why 2. ?

In a file if there are 100's of classes then how Java can understand which one to invoke, so that is why
file name should be equal to the public class name


eg :

Employee.java

    class Employee {

    }
