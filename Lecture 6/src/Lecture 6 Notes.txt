// Static Method:
    1. These Methods are associated with the class
    2. can be used with the class name
    3. static methods cannot access non-static instance variables and methods
    4. static methods cannot be overriden

    When to declare static method:
        1. Methods which do not modify the state of the object can be declared static
        2. Utility method which do not use any instance variable and compute only on arguments

// Why static methods cannot be overriden ?
    static is compile time - not runtime


    // Main2
        // Person.java, Doctor.java
