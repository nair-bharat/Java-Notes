Methods - Part 1
    1. used to perform certain task
    2. collection of instruction that performs specific task
    3. bring code readability and re-usability

    how to declare method:
        public int sum(int a, int b) throws Exception {
            // method body
        }

    // Access specifiers:

        1. public: can be accessed through any class in any package
        2. private: can be accessed by methods only in the same class
        3. protected: can be accessed by other classes in same package or other subclasses in different package
        4. default: if we do not specify anything, default access specifier is used by Java. It can be only accessed by classes in same package.

        eg:
            SalesDepartment package:
                Analytics class
                        Invoice invoice = new Invoice();
                        // invoice.getProfitStatements(); - won't be able to access within same package as well.
                        invoice.getAdditionalDetails(); // able to access protected method - same package
                        invoice.getMiscData(); // able to access - Default access specifier
                Invoice class
                    methods:
                        getInvoice (public method)
                        getProfitStatements (private method)
                        getAdditionalDetails (protected method and belongs to same package)
                        getMiscData (default method)

            HumanResourcesDepartment package:
                EmployeeSalaryDetails class:
                        Invoice invoice = new Invoice();
                        invoice.getInvoice(); // we can access this method
                        // invoice.getProfitStatements() - we won't be able to access this method




    // return type:
        1. Method do not return anything use void
        2. Use class name or primitive data types as return type of method

    // Method name:
        1. It should be verb (some kind of action)
        2. Should start with small letter and follow camel case in case of multiple words


    // Types of Method:
        1. System defined Method
            Methods which are already defined and ready to use in Java like Math.sqrt()

        2. User defined Method:
            Methods which we create

        3. Overloaded Method:
            More than 1 method with same name in same class (return type not considered)
                // TaxStatements.java

        4. Overriden Method:
            SubClass has same method as parent
                // SocialMedia.java
                    // Poster.java
